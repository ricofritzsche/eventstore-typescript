# Get Account Feature

This feature demonstrates account state reconstruction from events for read operations.

**Note**: This implementation rebuilds the account state from the event store on every query, which is done here for demonstration purposes only. In a real-world production system, account data should be maintained in a dedicated read model table (projection) that gets updated whenever relevant events are processed. This would provide much better performance for read operations while maintaining eventual consistency.
